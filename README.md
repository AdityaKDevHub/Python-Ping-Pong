# Python Ping Pong
> ## Introduction
> This is my first PyGame and Tkinter project. It is a proof of concept of building video games in Python. \
> Instructions regarding the objective and controls of the game will be briefed in a dialog box before the game starts.

> ## Installation
> Installation requires PyGame installed in your device. Tkinter is generally included in your Python distribution beforehand, but make sure you have it in your device.
>
> You can either clone this repository via Git or download the .zip file from the green _Code_ button in the repository page. \
Finally, you need to run ```main.py``` through Python to enter the game.

Thank You! \
